# Strange Phone

Strange Phone is a simple and normal project from Harper Reed. It is a payphone that is permenantly installed in his backyard. You can call this payphone by dialing: [+81 3 4589 4757](tel:+81345894757). Yes, this is a Tokyo, JP number. Tolls will most likely apply. 

If you call within operating hours, maybe someone will answer the phone. You never know. 

The real reason for having a payphone is to create a blank (ish) vessel for putting stickers and other forms of street art onto. As a young person (when payphones were real), I was always excited to stumble across a drawn upon [label 228](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_228) with some nice art on it. 

I wanted to create a object that artists could contribute to via stickers, slaps, and other labels. Whether it be a character or a tag - the strange phone is a home. 

### Contribute

If you want to contribute a sticker to the phone, send it to: 

    Strange Phone c/o Harper Reed
    1658 N Milwaukee ave
    #519
    Chicago, IL 60647

I will affix the sticker to phone and take a photo of it and post it to the [strange_phone](http://instagram.com/strange_phone) insta. Obviously, I will use my own discretion on whether it fits, etc. I imagine most pieces will be awesome. 

I would like to keep a constant stream of stickers and art going. Please help! 

#### Code

The website is in `/docs` and the firebase functions for handling twilio are in `/firebase`. 

Feel free to play around. My eventual goal is to make it very simple to do a "strangephone" with any sip phone (payphone or not). Could be fun. 

##### Code TODO

* Make recording better
* Store log of calls in and calls out - including update with recording and transcript
* Create API to access the recordings and transcripts from strangephone.com
* Clean up twilio parts
* Maybe migrate to twilio sip trunk instead of sipsorcery? 

### Thanks

Thanks for [Shawnimals](https://www.instagram.com/shawnimals/), [T-Money](https://www.instagram.com/tmoneydelarue/) and [Lauren Asta](https://www.instagram.com/lauren_asta/) for making our garage awesome. Also, talking about street art with these folks helped solidify my plans to make this payphone strange.  You should commission some work from them.

I have been thinking about this project since I registered the strangephone domain in January 2006. I am excited that I have a place to put my wonderful payphone and place for y'all to put stickers.
